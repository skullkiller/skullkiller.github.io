About Me
========

Hi blog surfers in general.

I’m a Portuguese SQL Server professional.

I’m mainly focused in the DWH side of SQL Server but a lover of SQL Server full product.

My blog is about this and powershell. I use the last a lost as a way of improving my DWH/SQL Work.

I like to do other stuff IT/technology related, so I’ll share some thoughts about this too.

Thanks for visiting my blog.

My original nickname is skullkiller, so I’ll be using that to sign my blog posts. I’ll leave my real name for later.
