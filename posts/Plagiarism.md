Plagiarism
===========

Hi

Plagiarism is an important topic nowadays. Lots of people don’t respect the work of others. That's bad to say the least.

I’m committed to respect the work of others in this blog of mine. I pretend to reference original content I refer to, either scripts or others, as much as I can.

Since I’ll be posting some old scripts I have in my personal archive and I don’t have many references of where they came from, I apologize to the original creators/authors for that.

-If you think I’m copying  any content from someone, even if not your self’s, please contact me privately so I can add the proper references (or even remove the content).-

Once again, sorry for copying your content, if that’s the case.
